# Infos

We have Configs and a basic ClickGui but its usefull and easily understandable, we're just 2 devs working on the Client
The Client will cost arround 5â‚¬ on the Webside when we release the Webside
We are working on an SMOOOTH AIMBOT at the moment
I'm NOT a good programer i started with java like a few month ago that means I will need time to finish stuff and the way i do things arnt the best so dont blame me for that and I am working on another Client some times too (Yasashii-Client, ima not past the link just find it in my YouTube Videos).
We DONT want to rat people we want to make a save to use and good 1.8.9 Ghost Client.
You can apply for Beta and if your application is good we will accept it and you will get Beta Acces and if the Client is out of Beta we will give Beta Acces People a Discount on the Client or make it free.

--> BUT REMEMBER WE HAVE A REAL LIVE TOO,
That doesnt mean we will not/not be able to work on the Client we just dont have time sometimes,
Dont expect us to work on the Client all the Time like others do.
Just dont think we're just working on the Client!

We're both still in School that means we will most likely not have much time to work on the Client but it will get Updates
